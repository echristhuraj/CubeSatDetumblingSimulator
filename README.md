# CubeSat Detumbling Simulator

Detumbling is the process of slowing the angular rates of a satellite, such as a CubeSat (a small 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm spacecraft) orbiting in low Earth orbit (LEO),
until its attitude (Simulates a LEO CubeSat detumbling (with a 3-axis magnetorquer set, a magnetometer, and a gyroscope) using a B-dot algorithm and low pass filters in closed-loop feedback.
